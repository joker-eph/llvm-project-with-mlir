/// Implements a high-level vectorization strategy on a Function.
/// The abstraction used is that of super-vectors, which provide a single,
/// compact, representation in the vector types, information that is expected
/// to reduce the impact of the phase ordering problem
///
/// Vector granularity:
/// ===================
/// This pass is designed to perform vectorization at a super-vector
/// granularity. A super-vector is loosely defined as a vector type that is a
/// multiple of a "good" vector size so the HW can efficiently implement a set
/// of high-level primitives. Multiple is understood along any dimension; e.g.
/// both vector<16xf32> and vector<2x8xf32> are valid super-vectors for a
/// vector<8xf32> HW vector. Note that a "good vector size so the HW can
/// efficiently implement a set of high-level primitives" is not necessarily an
/// integer multiple of actual hardware registers. We leave details of this
/// distinction unspecified for now.
///
/// Some may prefer the terminology a "tile of HW vectors". In this case, one
/// should note that super-vectors implement an "always full tile" abstraction.
/// They guarantee no partial-tile separation is necessary by relying on a
/// high-level copy-reshape abstraction that we call vector_transfer. This
/// copy-reshape operations is also responsible for performing layout
/// transposition if necessary. In the general case this will require a scoped
/// allocation in some notional local memory.
///
/// Whatever the mental model one prefers to use for this abstraction, the key
/// point is that we burn into a single, compact, representation in the vector
/// types, information that is expected to reduce the impact of the phase
/// ordering problem. Indeed, a vector type conveys information that:
///   1. the associated loops have dependency semantics that do not prevent
///      vectorization;
///   2. the associate loops have been sliced in chunks of static sizes that are
///      compatible with vector sizes (i.e. similar to unroll-and-jam);
///   3. the inner loops, in the unroll-and-jam analogy of 2, are captured by
///   the
///      vector type and no vectorization hampering transformations can be
///      applied to them anymore;
///   4. the underlying memrefs are accessed in some notional contiguous way
///      that allows loading into vectors with some amount of spatial locality;
/// In other words, super-vectorization provides a level of separation of
/// concern by way of opacity to subsequent passes. This has the effect of
/// encapsulating and propagating vectorization constraints down the list of
/// passes until we are ready to lower further.
///
/// For a particular target, a notion of minimal n-d vector size will be
/// specified and vectorization targets a multiple of those. In the following
/// paragraph, let "k ." represent "a multiple of", to be understood as a
/// multiple in the same dimension (e.g. vector<16 x k . 128> summarizes
/// vector<16 x 128>, vector<16 x 256>, vector<16 x 1024>, etc).
///
/// Some non-exhaustive notable super-vector sizes of interest include:
///   - CPU: vector<k . HW_vector_size>,
///          vector<k' . core_count x k . HW_vector_size>,
///          vector<socket_count x k' . core_count x k . HW_vector_size>;
///   - GPU: vector<k . warp_size>,
///          vector<k . warp_size x float2>,
///          vector<k . warp_size x float4>,
///          vector<k . warp_size x 4 x 4x 4> (for tensor_core sizes).
///
/// Loops and operations are emitted that operate on those super-vector shapes.
/// Subsequent lowering passes will materialize to actual HW vector sizes. These
/// passes are expected to be (gradually) more target-specific.
///
/// At a high level, a vectorized load in a loop will resemble:
/// ```mlir
///   for %i = ? to ? step ? {
///     %v_a = "vector_transfer_read" (A, %i) : (memref<?xf32>, index) ->
///                                              vector<128xf32>
///   }
/// ```
/// It is the reponsibility of the implementation of the vector_transfer_read
/// to materialize vector registers from the original scalar memrefs.
/// A later (more target-dependent) lowering pass will materialize to actual HW
/// vector sizes. This lowering may be occur at different times:
///   1. at the MLIR level into a combination of loops, unrolling, DmaStartOp +
///   DmaWaitOp + vectorized operations
///      for data transformations and shuffle; thus opening opportunities for
///      unrolling and pipelining. This is an instance of library call
///      "whiteboxing"; or
///   2. later in the a target-specific lowering pass or hand-written library
///      call; achieving full separation of concerns. This is an instance of
///      library call; or
///   3. a mix of both, e.g. based on a model.
/// In the future, these operations will expose a contract to constrain the
/// search on vectorization patterns and sizes.
///
/// Occurrence of super-vectorization in the compiler flow:
/// =======================================================
/// This is an active area of investigation. We start with 2 remarks to position
/// super-vectorization in the context of existing ongoing work: LLVM VPLAN
/// and LLVM SLP Vectorizer.
///
/// LLVM VPLAN:
/// -----------
/// The astute reader may have noticed that in the limit, super-vectorization
/// can be applied at a similar time and with similar objectives than VPLAN.
/// For instance, in the case of a traditional, polyhedral compilation-flow (for
/// instance, the PPCG project uses ISL to provide dependence analysis,
/// multi-level(scheduling + tiling), lifting footprint to fast memory,
/// communication synthesis, mapping, register optimizations) and before
/// unrolling. When vectorization is applied at this *late* level in a typical
/// polyhedral flow, and is instantiated with actual hardware vector sizes,
/// super-vectorization is expected to match (or subsume) the type of patterns
/// that LLVM's VPLAN aims at targeting. The main difference here is that MLIR
/// is higher level and our implementation should be significantly simpler. Also
/// note that in this mode, recursive patterns are probably a bit of an overkill
/// although it is reasonable to expect that mixing a bit of outer loop and
/// inner loop vectorization + unrolling will provide interesting choices to
/// MLIR.
///
/// LLVM SLP Vectorizer:
/// --------------------
/// Super-vectorization however is not meant to be usable in a similar fashion
/// to the SLP vectorizer. The main difference lies in the information that
/// both vectorizers use: super-vectorization examines contiguity of memory
/// references along fastest varying dimensions and loops with recursive nested
/// patterns capturing imperfectly-nested loop nests; the SLP vectorizer, on
/// the other hand, performs flat pattern matching inside a single unrolled loop
/// body and stitches together pieces of load and store instructions into full
/// 1-D vectors. We envision that the SLP vectorizer is a good way to capture
/// innermost loop, control-flow dependent patterns that super-vectorization may
/// not be able to capture easily. In other words, super-vectorization does not
/// aim at replacing the SLP vectorizer and the two solutions are complementary.
///
/// Ongoing investigations:
/// -----------------------
/// We discuss the following *early* places where super-vectorization is
/// applicable and touch on the expected benefits and risks . We list the
/// opportunities in the context of the traditional polyhedral compiler flow
/// described in PPCG. There are essentially 6 places in the MLIR pass pipeline
/// we expect to experiment with super-vectorization:
/// 1. Right after language lowering to MLIR: this is the earliest time where
///    super-vectorization is expected to be applied. At this level, all the
///    language/user/library-level annotations are available and can be fully
///    exploited. Examples include loop-type annotations (such as parallel,
///    reduction, scan, dependence distance vector, vectorizable) as well as
///    memory access annotations (such as non-aliasing writes guaranteed,
///    indirect accesses that are permutations by construction) accesses or
///    that a particular operation is prescribed atomic by the user. At this
///    level, anything that enriches what dependence analysis can do should be
///    aggressively exploited. At this level we are close to having explicit
///    vector types in the language, except we do not impose that burden on the
///    programmer/library: we derive information from scalar code + annotations.
/// 2. After dependence analysis and before polyhedral scheduling: the
///    information that supports vectorization does not need to be supplied by a
///    higher level of abstraction. Traditional dependence anaysis is available
///    in MLIR and will be used to drive vectorization and cost models.
///
/// Let's pause here and remark that applying super-vectorization as described
/// in 1. and 2. presents clear opportunities and risks:
///   - the opportunity is that vectorization is burned in the type system and
///   is protected from the adverse effect of loop scheduling, tiling, loop
///   interchange and all passes downstream. Provided that subsequent passes are
///   able to operate on vector types; the vector shapes, associated loop
///   iterator properties, alignment, and contiguity of fastest varying
///   dimensions are preserved until we lower the super-vector types. We expect
///   this to significantly rein in on the adverse effects of phase ordering.
///   - the risks are that a. all passes after super-vectorization have to work
///   on elemental vector types (not that this is always true, wherever
///   vectorization is applied) and b. that imposing vectorization constraints
///   too early may be overall detrimental to loop fusion, tiling and other
///   transformations because the dependence distances are coarsened when
///   operating on elemental vector types. For this reason, the pattern
///   profitability analysis should include a component that also captures the
///   maximal amount of fusion available under a particular pattern. This is
///   still at the stage of rought ideas but in this context, search is our
///   friend as the Tensor Comprehensions and auto-TVM contributions
///   demonstrated previously.
/// Bottom-line is we do not yet have good answers for the above but aim at
/// making it easy to answer such questions.
///
/// Back to our listing, the last places where early super-vectorization makes
/// sense are:
/// 3. right after polyhedral-style scheduling: PLUTO-style algorithms are known
///    to improve locality, parallelism and be configurable (e.g. max-fuse,
///    smart-fuse etc). They can also have adverse effects on contiguity
///    properties that are required for vectorization but the vector_transfer
///    copy-reshape-pad-transpose abstraction is expected to help recapture
///    these properties.
/// 4. right after polyhedral-style scheduling+tiling;
/// 5. right after scheduling+tiling+rescheduling: points 4 and 5 represent
///    probably the most promising places because applying tiling achieves a
///    separation of concerns that allows rescheduling to worry less about
///    locality and more about parallelism and distribution (e.g. min-fuse).
///
/// At these levels the risk-reward looks different: on one hand we probably
/// lost a good deal of language/user/library-level annotation; on the other
/// hand we gained parallelism and locality through scheduling and tiling.
/// However we probably want to ensure tiling is compatible with the
/// full-tile-only abstraction used in super-vectorization or suffer the
/// consequences. It is too early to place bets on what will win but we expect
/// super-vectorization to be the right abstraction to allow exploring at all
/// these levels. And again, search is our friend.
///
/// Lastly, we mention it again here:
/// 6. as a MLIR-based alternative to VPLAN.
///
/// Lowering, unrolling, pipelining:
/// ================================
/// TODO(ntv): point to the proper places.
///
/// Algorithm:
/// ==========
/// The algorithm proceeds in a few steps:
///  1. defining super-vectorization patterns and matching them on the tree of
///     ForInst. A super-vectorization pattern is defined as a recursive data
///     structures that matches and captures nested, imperfectly-nested loops
///     that have a. comformable loop annotations attached (e.g. parallel,
///     reduction, vectoriable, ...) as well as b. all contiguous load/store
///     operations along a specified minor dimension (not necessarily the
///     fastest varying) ;
///  2. analyzing those patterns for profitability (TODO(ntv): and
///     interference);
///  3. Then, for each pattern in order:
///    a. applying iterative rewriting of the loop and the load operations in
///       DFS postorder. Rewriting is implemented by coarsening the loops and
///       turning load operations into opaque vector_transfer_read ops;
///    b. keeping track of the load operations encountered as "roots" and the
///       store operations as "terminators";
///    c. traversing the use-def chains starting from the roots and iteratively
///       propagating vectorized values. Scalar values that are encountered
///       during this process must come from outside the scope of the current
///       pattern (TODO(ntv): enforce this and generalize). Such a scalar value
///       is vectorized only if it is a constant (into a vector splat). The
///       non-constant case is not supported for now and results in the pattern
///       failing to vectorize;
///    d. performing a second traversal on the terminators (store ops) to
///       rewriting the scalar value they write to memory into vector form.
///       If the scalar value has been vectorized previously, we simply replace
///       it by its vector form. Otherwise, if the scalar value is a constant,
///       it is vectorized into a splat. In all other cases, vectorization for
///       the pattern currently fails.
///    e. if everything under the root ForInst in the current pattern vectorizes
///       properly, we commit that loop to the IR. Otherwise we discard it and
///       restore a previously cloned version of the loop. Thanks to the
///       recursive scoping nature of matchers and captured patterns, this is
///       transparently achieved by a simple RAII implementation.
///    f. vectorization is applied on the next pattern in the list. Because
///       pattern interference avoidance is not yet implemented and that we do
///       not support further vectorizing an already vector load we need to
///       re-verify that the pattern is still vectorizable. This is expected to
///       make cost models more difficult to write and is subject to improvement
///       in the future.
///
/// Points c. and d. above are worth additional comment. In most passes that
/// do not change the type of operands, it is usually preferred to eagerly
/// `replaceAllUsesWith`. Unfortunately this does not work for vectorization
/// because during the use-def chain traversal, all the operands of an operation
/// must be available in vector form. Trying to propagate eagerly makes the IR
/// temporarily invalid and results in errors such as:
///   `vectorize.mlir:308:13: error: 'addf' op requires the same type for all
///   operands and results
///      %s5 = addf %a5, %b5 : f32`
///
/// Lastly, we show a minimal example for which use-def chains rooted in load /
/// vector_transfer_read are not enough. This is what motivated splitting
/// terminator processing out of the use-def chains starting from loads. In the
/// following snippet, there is simply no load::
/// ```mlir
/// mlfunc @fill(%A : memref<128xf32>) -> () {
///   %f1 = constant 1.0 : f32
///   for %i0 = 0 to 32 {
///     store %f1, %A[%i0] : memref<128xf32, 0>
///   }
///   return
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Choice of loop transformation to support the algorithm:
/// =======================================================
/// The choice of loop transformation to apply for coarsening vectorized loops
/// is still subject to exploratory tradeoffs. In particular, say we want to
/// vectorize by a factor 128, we want to transform the following input:
/// ```mlir
///   for %i = %M to %N {
///     %a = load A[%i] : memref<?xf32>
///   }
/// ```
///
/// Traditionally, one would vectorize late (after scheduling, tiling,
/// memory promotion etc) say after stripmining (and potentially unrolling in
/// the case of LLVM's SLP vectorizer):
/// ```mlir
///   for %i = floor(%M, 128) to ceil(%N, 128) {
///     for %ii = max(%M, 128 * %i) to min(%N, 128*%i + 127) {
///       %a = load A[%ii] : memref<?xf32>
///     }
///   }
/// ```
///
/// Instead, we seek to vectorize early and freeze vector types before
/// scheduling, so we want to generate a pattern that resembles:
/// ```mlir
///   for %i = ? to ? step ? {
///     %v_a = "vector_transfer_read" (A, %i) : (memref<?xf32>, index) ->
///                                              vector<128xf32>
///   }
/// ```
///
/// i. simply dividing the lower / upper bounds by 128 creates issues
///    when representing expressions such as ii + 1 because now we only
///    have access to original values that have been divided. Additional
///    information is needed to specify accesses at below-128 granularity;
/// ii. another alternative is to coarsen the loop step but this may have
///    consequences on dependence analysis and fusability of loops: fusable
///    loops probably need to have the same step (because we don't want to
///    stripmine/unroll to enable fusion).
/// As a consequence, we choose to represent the coarsening using the loop
/// step for now and reevaluate in the future. Note that we can renormalize
/// loop steps later if/when we have evidence that they are problematic.
///
/// For the simple strawman example above, vectorizing for a 1-D vector
/// abstraction of size 128 returns code similar to:
/// ```mlir
///   for %i = %M to %N step 128 {
///     %v_a = "vector_transfer_read" (A, %i) : (memref<?xf32>, index) ->
///                                              vector<128xf32>
///   }
/// ```
///
/// Unsupported cases, extensions, and work in progress (help welcome :-) ):
/// ========================================================================
///   1. lowering to concrete vector types for various HW;
///   2. reduction support;
///   3. non-effecting padding during vector_transfer_read and filter during
///      vector_transfer_write;
///   4. misalignment support vector_transfer_read / vector_transfer_write
